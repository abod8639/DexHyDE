# tree-sitter-po

This crate provides a PO grammar for the [tree-sitter][] parsing library. To
use this crate, add it to the `[dependencies]` section of your `Cargo.toml`
file. (Note that you will probably also need to depend on the
[`tree-sitter`][tree-sitter crate] crate to use the parsed result in any useful
way.)

```toml
[dependencies]
tree-sitter = "~0.20.3"
tree-sitter-po = "0.0.1"
```

Typically, you will use the [language][language func] function to add this
grammar to a tree-sitter [Parser][], and then use the parser to parse some code:

```rust
let code = r#"
  # test
  #. hi
  #: modules/user/views_handler_filter_user_name.inc:112
  #~ msgid "hi"
  msgid "Unable to find user: @users"
  msgid_plural "Unable to find users: @users"
"#;
let mut parser = Parser::new();
parser.set_language(tree_sitter_po::language()).expect("Error loading PO grammar");
let parsed = parser.parse(code, None);
```

If you have any questions, please reach out to us in the [tree-sitter
discussions] page.
